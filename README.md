# Railway Planner

The **Railway Planner** is a comprehensive application designed to manage and query railway-related data efficiently. It provides functionalities for storing and retrieving information about railway stations, journeys, and their associated reviews and ratings. The system leverages advanced data structures and algorithms to offer quick and precise responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: 
  - **Stations**: Manage information about railway stations.
  - **Journeys**: Store details about different railway journeys.
  - **Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to submit and query reviews and ratings for stations and journeys.

- **Data Structures**:
  - **Dictionaries**: For fast lookups of stations, journeys, and reviews.
  - **AVL Trees**: To maintain sorted data efficiently and support quick insertions and deletions.
  - **Binary Heaps**: Used for priority-based operations, such as retrieving the highest-rated journeys.

- **Search and Query Features**:
  - **Tries**: Implemented for efficient search completion, helping users quickly find relevant stations and journeys.
  - **KMP Algorithm**: Utilized for efficiently retrieving reviews that contain specific keywords or desirable words.

- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Used for exploring possible journeys and connections.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Helps in finding the shortest path in terms of stops between stations.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Optimizes journey planning based on time and cost constraints to find the shortest or least expensive path.
